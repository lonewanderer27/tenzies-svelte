<h1>About Tenzies!</h1>
<p>
	Tenzies is a game that was originally built using React as its JavaScript framework. However, it
	is now being rewritten in Svelte. Tenzies is a fun and challenging game that requires players to
	use strategy and quick thinking to win. The game involves rolling dice and trying to get the
	highest score possible by selecting the best combination of dice. With its new Svelte framework,
	Tenzies promises to be even more exciting and engaging than ever before!
